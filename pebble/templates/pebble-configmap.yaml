  # A root cert and key, for use by:
  # 1. Pebble's ACME server requires TLS communication: this root cert will
  #    create a leaf cert for Pebble to use in its installed namespace.
  #
  # 2. ACME client's speaking with Pebble need to trust this root cert in order
  #    to accept Pebble's leaf cert.
  #
  # NOTE: This root cert, or its leaf certs, are unrelated to the certs Pebble
  #       will provision as an ACME server. Pebble always recreates a new root
  #       cert on each startup and use it to create certs for the ACME clients.
  #       These temporary root certs are exposed through a REST API at /roots/0
  #       on the acme-mgmt port.
